Overview

- img/ — background and profile images (e.g. background2.avif, profile image)
- README.md` — run/deploy instructions and notes


Session log 
------------------------------------------------

Session 1 — Setting up
- Figure out how to set up Git on Visual Studio Code to to make it easier
to push and pull git, since im already familair with git this is a very easy
to do 
- Write a few files to push and pull git and commit the first commit 
to testing it out
- The first 2 commit is just me try to get comfortable with git in VS

Session 2 — HTML initial layout
- Goal: Create a semantic, accessible page structure and a clear hero area.

- Just messing around with texting and formatting and what need to be there,
I already have a resume so I just Copy/Paste everything on it and make sure
everything look good on the layout, 
- Ensure heading/div/p everything format properly. Pretiier is a huge help

Session 3 — HTML cleanup / NavBar
- Goal: Make the nav accessible and fix malformed HTML.

- Added class/id to the layout to prepare for styling
- Added a navbar using class material
- Style a tiny bit of navbar

Session 4 — Style / JavaScript planning
- Goal: Decide visual system and the minimal JS interactions required.

Planning details:
- Background: white background, cyan/teal accents
- Info: card-style white content areas, 
- Home: Full page with welcome message and profile picture
- Media: hree breakpoints (1100px, 900px, 720px) to
convert the hero to a stacked layout and implemented a (outside of class) 
a hamburger menu on phone users.
- JS interactions: mobile nav toggle (open/close, using Aria (AI SUGGESTION))
and a small quiz control that sets a result message when buttons are clicked.
- Decorative assets: use Font Awesome CDN for the snowflake watermark for
my liking.

Session 5 — Implementing CSS and JS
- Goal: Build the visual layout and interactivity from the plan.

CSS:
- Starting off building navbar with material we already covered in class,
everything should be easy just mess around with styling. 
- Research for a feature that i want to implemented using the sidebar button,
show the navbar in smaller screens. Using 2-3 videos to build the hamburger
button for navigating navbar, including featur- Build home page with a idea of i want my profile-photo and some text on therees like close after pressing.

- Styled content cards (div-(content)) with whiter rounded corners, and soft shadows.
JS:
- Added `DOMContentLoaded` listener to:
	- header and nav
	- Close the mobile menu when a nav link is clicked.
	- Handle quiz button clicks by reading data-answer and writing to #quiz-result.
	- Verified aria-expanded is updated whenever the menu opens/closes.

Session 6 — Accessibility audit and fixes
- Goal: Run WAVE/manual checks and fix issues affecting keyboard and
	assistive-technology users.
- Ran WAVE and fixed the heading order issue: changed the quiz heading
from h4 to h3 so no levels are skipped under section headings.
- Only pass WAVE check, Lighthouse still got a ton of problem or I just
use it poorly
	

Session 7 — README, documentation and final polish
- Goal: Record how to run and deploy the site and document work for graders.
Wrote README.md with an overview, file list, run instructions
- Wrote this journal.txt to capture the session log
- Record a video presentation through OBS and uploaded on Youtube?


Summary
-------------------------------------------------
 
Lessons learned (outside class content)
- Managing layered backgrounds (gradient + image) for consistent readability.
- Box shadow, effect through CSS 
- Importance of updating ARIA state in JS for assistive technologies.

Future Work
- Update content is the div-content session, right now it kinda shallow
but meet the requirements
- Do some more JS stuff, multiple pages could be a good idea
- Can be used to have a project on my resume
